# neural_network_framework
Neural network framework developed to predict construction project performance.

## Summary of Results
Predicted the ROI level of construction projects with 78% accuracy under 10-fold cross-validation by implementing a neural network framework with customizable hyperparameters including network structures, activation functions, and regularization parameters. The results of this work culminated in a conference paper publication in the 2017 International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering (IWCCE) in Seattle, Washington, USA.

## Overview
This codebase was developed in 2016 to support ongoing research efforts at the Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE), Stanford University. Data was collected from 108 worldwide construction project case studies with 50 features in Virtual Design and Construction (VDC). 

While project case study data is retracted since the data belongs to CIFE, Stanford University, this codebase includes a robust and modular neural network framework written in Python that supports various customizations on the neural network structure and hyperparameters, along with a small plotting library to visualize results. The modules are under the `utils` folder.

A sample of the training results are showcased under the Logs folder.
